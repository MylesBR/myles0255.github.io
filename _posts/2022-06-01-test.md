# How to Mount NFS share on Debian

The network file system NFS is an efficient way of sharing files and directories to other machines in a network. It is based on client-server architecture, where the server directory is mounted onto client systems. NFS allows clients to access shared directories as if they are a part of their own system, and remains a popular way of sharing files among Linux systems.

In this article, we will mount a NFS share on a Debian client machine manually, as well as automatically, upon system boot.

We will use Debian system to run the commands and procedures discussed in this article.

## Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, be sure that:

* NFS server is installed and running on the remote machine
* NFS shared directory on the remote server is exporte
* Firewall is allowing access to NFS clients
